== Expression creation and evaluation

`Sum`, `Product`, `Equals`, `Negation`, etc. are simply objects, without evaluation logic.
The logic sits in the `EvalSum`, `EvalProduct` etc. classes.
There are no static methods, for ease of overriding later.

The user uses the `Runtime` interface to

- create an object, using a `newSum` operation; this is in the `Factory` interface
- create the optimal object, using a `sum` operation; this is in the `Eval` interface
